# Count Objects From The Image With MATLAB

<p>The goal of this project was to count objects in an image, where there are also overlapping objects, which will increase the difficulty of detecting their exact number.</p>
<p>To be more precise, I count the number of flowers from an image. The challenging part was that the flowers were very close to each other, and many of them intersected.</p>

<p>Bellow there is the <b>original image</b> on left and the <b>segmentation process</b> of the MATLAB on the right.</p>

## The segmentation process

#### Segmentation using region picker
